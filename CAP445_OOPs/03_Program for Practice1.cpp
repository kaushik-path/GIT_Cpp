/*
A doctor is giving advice to patient about how to maintain our body which type of food we should take. For that doctor asks for the number of calories and fat grams in a food. Then it displays the percentage of calories that come from fat. If the calories from fat are less then 30% of the total calories of the food, it should also display a message indicating that the food is low in fat.
Note:- Note: consider one gram of fat has 9 calories
