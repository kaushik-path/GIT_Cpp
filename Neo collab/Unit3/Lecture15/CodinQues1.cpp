/*Problem Statement
Akil wants to write a program that creates a Person object and allows the user to enter the name and age of that person. The program should then display the name and age of the created object.
Approach:
Define a Person class with private member variables like name and age.
Implement a default constructor that displays a message indicating it has been called.
Implement a display() member function that prints the name and age of the current object.
Implement the setName() and setAge() member functions to set the name and age of the object.
 Note: This is a sample question asked in a HCL interview.
Input format :
The first input consists of the name of the person as a string.
The second input consists of the age of the person as an integer.
Output format :
The output displays the following messages:
"Default constructor is called" (displayed once when the Person object is created)
"Name of current object: [name]" (displays the name entered by the user)
"Age of current object: [age]" (displays the age entered by the user).
Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
age > 0
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
Akil
23
Output 1 :
Default constructor is called
Name of current object: Akil
Age of current object: 23
Input 2 :
Jaanu
24
Output 2 :
Default constructor is called
Name of current object: Jaanu
Age of current object: 24
